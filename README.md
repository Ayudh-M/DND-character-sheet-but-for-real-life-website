# DND character sheet but for real life website
Essentially I was wondering if I would be taken into a DND world what would my character look like and wanted to create a website that I could host on githb pages that would allow one to read descriptions of characters and  potentially make a character sheet of themselves and also give themselves buffs, debuffs and skills,with the ultimage goal being gamification of real life to make life more fun and to also gague and understand yourself better to live a better life, I may also add some basic quizes later for each stat to give the character a reccomendation on where their stat value actually lies
